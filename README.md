# SpellOType2.0

Scratch code for SpellOType 2.0

* Spell’O’Type started as a creation of love from a teenager for her sister whose learning journey was a challenge in many ways. The Spell’O’Type program saw a lot of success with many students, especially during the on-line programs during the Covid-19 pandemic. This encouraged VANSHIKA MITTAL to create the next level of the program. Now we have **Spell’O’Type 2.0** which takes the learning beyond words and now moves into sentences.

* The second level is really great for students who have learnt to identify the letters on the key-pad and can spell simple words. Here, the students refresh their spelling of the word before typing it out from memory to complete a sentence. They get to hear the sentence read out to them once the word is typed out correctly, followed by an accolade that reinforces their joy of success. There is no wrong answer and the program gives the students the option to receive prompts to finally complete the word correctly. 

* The students and teachers of Samatha Learning Center, Bangalore, India [www.samathalearning.com](https://samathalearning.com/) are very happy that Vanshika Mittal put in earnest efforts in coming out with Spell’O’Type 2.0. With so much variety for students to choose from and to do in this version, they are sure to be looking forward to their classes eagerly.
